Experience the power of machine learning with our Movie Recommendation project! Simply run the "Movie-recommendation.ipynb" file, and watch as two essential pickle files are generated for you. Don't forget to place these files into the designated "model" folder.

Once you have completed the setup, it's time to launch the project! Just execute the command "streamlit run app.py" and voila, our user-friendly interface will come to life. Discover a whole new level of movie recommendations, tailored just for you.

With our project, you'll have access to a comprehensive selection of movies and their corresponding posters. By selecting a movie of your choice, our machine learning algorithm will analyze your selection and recommend five similar movies that are sure to captivate your interest.
